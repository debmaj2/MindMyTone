# MindMyTone
## MindMyTone is a Mobile Ringtone Automator.

When was the last time you felt irritated by that quirky ring-tone of your phone disturbing your trail of words in an important meeting? Or the last time you were woken up aggressively by your heavy metal ring-tone? It's *everyday*, probably.

So, what do you do? Keep your phone in silent mode? And often, miss your important calls and notifications. Luckily, you have someone to 'mind your phone's tone'.

MindMyTone intelligently syncs **Google's location info, Meeting Reminders, Office Hours, Weather data, voice input and sleeping hours** to make your phone ring in the right way on the right time or occasion.

Being Silent is now a myth!
